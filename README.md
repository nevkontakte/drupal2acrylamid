drupal2acrylamid
================

My custom migrations scripts I've used to convert my Drupal blog into static [acrylamid](http://posativ.org/acrylamid)-based blog.

It relies on several assumptions specific for my own blog, so use with care. Anyway, you may find it useful event if you'd prefer write your own scripts.
